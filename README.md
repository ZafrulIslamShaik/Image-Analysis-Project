# Least Squares Correlation for Geometric Alignment

## Project Overview

This project focuses on geometric alignment using an affine deformation model to correct perspective distortions in images. The goal is to compute the parameters of an affine transformation that can revert a distorted image back to its initial state using least squares correlation.

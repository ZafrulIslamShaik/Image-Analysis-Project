# Bag of Words with Template Matching for Image Classification

## Objective
This final project focuses on implementing template matching using normalized cross-correlation (NCC) with visual words, and subsequently applying the bag of visual words technique for image classification using k-nearest neighbors (kNN).

## Task 1: Template Matching
- **Objective**: Implement template matching using normalized cross-correlation (NCC) with visual words.
- Investigate the impact of different scales on results.
- Plot four successful template matching results with proper bounding boxes.

## Task 2: Bag of Visual Words
- **Objective**: Compute feature vectors using the template matching results from Task 1.
- Each feature vector has 6 values corresponding to the highest NCC for each visual word.
- Compute feature vectors for all 6 images and plot them.
- Use k-nearest neighbors (kNN, k=3) with majority voting for classification.
- Use images 1 to 4 as training samples and classify images 5 and 6 based on their feature vectors.



##  Conclusion

This final project delves into the practical implementation of template matching using normalized cross-correlation (NCC) with visual words and applies the bag of visual words technique for image classification using k-nearest neighbors (kNN).
